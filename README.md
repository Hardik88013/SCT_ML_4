🚀 SCT_ML_4 - Hand Gesture Recognition using Machine Learning
Excited to share Task 04 of my Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology!

🔍 Developed a Hand Gesture Recognition System that identifies and classifies hand gestures from images using machine learning models.
📊 Dataset used: LEAP GestRecog Dataset

🛠️ Project Highlights:

Real-time image pre-processing and feature extraction

Gesture classification using ML algorithms

Scalable for gesture-based control systems and HCI projects
